ERIC JONASSEN - PROJECT 2

This project is a password generator for "XKCD style" passwords. This page will generate
a string of 1-8 common words, and a number or special character if specified in the form.

For this project I used a list of common words from http://www.paulnoll.com/Books/Clear-English/English-3000-common-words.html,
