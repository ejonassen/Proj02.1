ERIC JONASSEN - PROJECT 2

URL: http://ericwebapps.me/proj02.1/passwords.php
Alternatively: http://104.131.38.41/proj02.1/passwords.php (If for some reason the first doesn't work. It's working for me in
firefox or other browsers but not in Chrome, I probably need to clear my cache)

This project is a password generator for "XKCD style" passwords. This page will generate
a string of 1-8 common words, and a number or special character if specified in the form.

For this project I used a list of common words from http://www.paulnoll.com/Books/Clear-English/English-3000-common-words.html,
tokenized here http://preshing.com/files/xkcd_pw.js.php
